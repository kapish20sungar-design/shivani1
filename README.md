# Will You Be My Valentine?

A cute (and inescapable) Valentine's Day website. The "No" button runs away from your cursor. Good luck saying no.

## Customize

Edit `config.json` to change the name, messages, button texts, and timing.

## Deploy

Push to `main` — GitHub Actions will deploy to GitHub Pages automatically.

Make sure **Settings > Pages > Source** is set to **GitHub Actions**.

## Preview locally
